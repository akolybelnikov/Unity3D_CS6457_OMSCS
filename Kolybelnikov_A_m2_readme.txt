## Project Instructions

### External resources

The project doesn't include any assets/resources acquired outside class.

### Building and Running the code

The project submission includes a working build of the game for both target platform OSX and Windows, both tested locally.

Add the project to your Unity Hub and open it in the Unity3D to generate all the files and folders locally. 

After the files of the project have been generated from the Project Settings, a new build/game can be run.

### Grading

To check if the game meets the assignemnt requirements, the project can be run with the executive files,
or opened in Unity and run in developer mode. The project includes only one scene, **demo**.

The player movement can be controlled with arrow keys of the keyboard, charcater switch is performed with the `t` key.
Match Target is performed with the left `ctrl` key when the root-motion dude is in the proximity of the button.
